# 📊 Job Placement Data Analysis using SQL

This repository presents a structured **SQL-based analysis** of a Job Placement dataset.  
The project focuses on deriving meaningful insights related to candidate demographics, educational background, experience levels, placement outcomes, and salary trends through practical SQL queries.

The queries range from **basic data exploration** to **intermediate analytical scenarios**, making this project ideal for strengthening real-world SQL skills.

| age | Candidate age |
| degree | Degree completed |
| stream | Academic specialization |
| college_name | Institution name |
| status | Placement status (Placed / Not Placed) |
| salary | Salary offered (if placed) |
| gpa | Academic performance score |
| experience | Years of professional experience |
